C++ Code-gen Templates
======================

C++ code generation with jinja2 will be used in favour of templates and macros
to make compilation errors less obscure, and allow the runtime to be easily debuggable.

All of the low-level data types such as vectors, matrices, and arrays will be auto-generated. 

Common math and geometry functions used in computer graphics will also be auto-generated.
